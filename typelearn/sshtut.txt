(A): ssh username@ip_address
all configs: ~/.ssh/
ssh-keys more safter than passwords
private-key - don't share with anyone
public-key - copy on remote-server
Creating ssh-keys:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
Copying public-key  on server:
ssh-copy-id username@ip_address

(B): File coniguration SSH (~/.ssh/config)
Why? To not remember ip_address,usernames, ports for every server!!!
Create or redactor file ~/.ssh/config
Add into block of code for every server:
Host my_awesome_server  #  Short remember name
    HostName 192.168.1.100  #  IP-address or domen name
    User root # Name of user on the server
    Port 22 # Port (default 22, you can not specify)
Now for connect enough this command:
ssh my_awesome_server

Security (be sure to study)
Turn off authentication from password. After ssh-keys (check ssh works stable)
On Server open /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
find #PasswordAuthentication yes, uncomment and change yes -> no
Restart service: systemctl restart sshd

TroubleShooting 
Network: ping ip_address
Check if right the username and password or ssh-key
Port 22 (or your coustom Port) is free
Logs (will be the message what is wrong with  your ssh)
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
# Or with systemd:
sudo journalctl -u ssh -f

Permissions to files SSH very strong
Folder ~/.ssh must have rights 700(drwx------)
private-key (example, id_rsa) must have rights 600 (-rw------)
public-key  (id_rsa.pub) must have rights 644 (-rw-r--r-)
